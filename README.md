Let's try out the Go programming language

## Important go commands
1. **Run** the go code: Go to the code directory and run
   ```go run main.go```
2. **Build** the code (host OS): Go to the code directory and run
   ```go build```
3. **Build** the code (foreign OS): Go to the code directory and run
   ```GOOS=<foreign os name> GOARCH=<platform name> go build```

## Notes
1. **Slices** can be thought of like arrays without limits.
2. A **map** is a kev-value pair storage for values.
3. IO processes are efficiently processed by the **bufio** package.
